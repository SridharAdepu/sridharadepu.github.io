<h1>Multiple PostDoc positions in  Cyber-Physical Systems Security, Formal Methods and Security Analysis</h1>


The research group in iTrust (https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg) at SUTD (Singapore University of Technology and Design, https://www.sutd.edu.sg) has an opening for a post-doctoral fellow. 

 
The positions are devoted to scientific research in the area of cyber-physical systems security, in particular for applications emphases on water systems. <br><br>

The research is driven by our testbeds in iTrust (https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_overview/).  This position focuses on the automated synthesis of defense and incident response mechanisms in cyber-physical systems. These include providing verifiable guarantees about the security of components that are being monitored and recover from a successful attack by performing actions to move the system state from an unsafe to a safe state. Hybrid modeling using formal models and machine learning models to analyze, verify and experimentation on testbeds. Formal models such as Alloy (
http://alloy.lcs.mit.edu/alloy/), UPPAAL (http://www.uppaal.org/). <br><br>

The iTrust offers a creative international environment, a possibility to conduct highly competitive research on a global scale in a multidisciplinary environment with a focus on cyber-physical systems security. The responsibilities of the position include successful research in the emerging field of cyber-physical systems security. 
<br><br>

We are looking for candidates with a Ph.D. degree in computer science or related fields with expertise in formal modeling and data-driven models with a focus on security. You should have a record of accomplishment in conducting original highly competitive scientific research and publishing your results in top conferences and scientific journals. Maturity, self-motivation and the ability to work both independently and as a team player are expected. You should have an interest in multi-disciplinary collaboration.  For further information, you may contact Jianying Zhou (http://jianying.space/).

<br><br>

High-quality living and low tax rates in Singapore.<br>
 

<h2>About iTrust</h2>

iTrust is the home of four world-class testbeds for research and education. Current operational testbeds are: Secure water Treatment (SWaT), Water Distribution (WADI), Electric Power and Intelligent Control (EPIC), and Shielded Room for IoT.  These testbeds offer researchers a unique opportunity to conduct cutting-edge research and validate the resulting tools and methods in a realistic setting. Collaboration with several private and government agencies in Singapore increases the chances of technology transfer and hence the research impact.
